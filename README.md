# Automated Onboarding Joiner Process

Developed an automated joiner process for onboarding employees using Power Automate and Azure AD. I designed an automated workflow that took data entered by new hires in Microsoft Forms and triggered an automated process in Power Automate. The workflow created the user in Azure Active Directory, and based on the userâ€™s department, it assigned them to the correct group. This automation saved time, improved security, and ensured that users were consistently placed in the correct access groups based on their roles.
